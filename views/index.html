          <p class="govuk-body">To give you the best possible start on your Companies House Experience journey, we’ve created Key - our new tool that’s designed to be a one-stop shop for all the essential knowledge you need as a new starter in the organisation and beyond.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">It provides useful information and resources, such as how to use the clocking system, how to set up for remote working and which support networks are available to you.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Key will be available to you for as long as you’re with us, meaning you’ll have access to all the key information you need, whenever you need it.</p>

          <div class="three-columns">
            <p class="govuk-body">At the moment, almost everyone is working remotely. When we do return to the office, there’s free parking, an onsite gym, cafeteria and kitchen facilities.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">There are several networks you can join that help you stay connected to people and get support when you need it.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You also get a highly competitive 30 days’ annual leave, as well as bank holidays, plus an additional day’s leave for the Queen’s birthday!</p>
          
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Office culture</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">At Companies House, you’re encouraged to bring your ‘whole self’ to work. There is no dress code, so whether you want to wear a shirt and tie or hoodie and jeans, that’s entirely up to you.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We’re adopting ‘smarter ways of working’, which is about flexibility, resilience and productivity. Examples of this include using new technologies, hot-desking and flexible working.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Flexi time</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Companies House uses a flexible working system. You are expected to work 37 hours per week, which is around 7 hours 20 per day (based on full time hours). However, you can usually work these hours in any pattern between 6am and 8pm.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can also build up extra flexi time across the week, so if you work over your contracted hours, you can take this as flexi leave when needed.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Volunteering</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">As an organisation, we want to do our bit to help out in the local community. That’s why we encourage you to volunteer for 3 days per year, as part of your working hours.</p>
