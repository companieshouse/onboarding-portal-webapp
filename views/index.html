            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Benefits of working at Companies House</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">At the moment, almost everyone is working remotely. When we do return to the office, there’s free parking, an onsite gym, cafeteria and kitchen facilities.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">There are several networks you can join that help you stay connected to people and get support when you need it.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You also get a highly competitive 30 days’ annual leave, as well as bank holidays, plus an additional day’s leave for the Queen’s birthday!</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Flexi time</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Companies House uses a flexible working system. You are expected to work 37 hours per week, which is around 7 hours 20 per day. However, you can usually work these hours in any pattern between 6am and 8pm.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can also build up extra flexi time across the week, so if you work over your contracted hours, you can take this as flexi leave when needed.</p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Office culture</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">At Companies House, you’re encouraged to bring your ‘whole self’ to work. There is no dress code, so whether you want to wear a shirt and tie or hoodie and jeans, that’s entirely up to you.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">We’re adopting ‘smarter ways of working’, which is about flexibility, resilience and productivity. Examples of this include using new technologies, hot-desking and flexible working.</p>
